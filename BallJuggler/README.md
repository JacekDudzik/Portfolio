The goal of the game is to place the ball between two lines that appears above player
by tapping the screen to make him jump and bounce the ball (LMP on computer).
Just make sure not to take too many tries as the distance between lines will close!</br>
Additionally scoring two or more points in a row will set the ball on fire doubling next scored points.
